title: "THE GARDEN"
---

__THE GARDEN__ is in a dried up deep sea oceanic trench. The way down is steep and dangerous. 

The bottom is even more dangerous. The air is thick with toxic particulates and the ground is criss-crossed with thin streams of lava. These both come from the plethora of obsidian covered hydrothermal vents. 

Life does exist down here. The long tapered chimney like vents are covered in the heat tolerant [BURNACLES](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#burnacles) and [ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/THE_GARDEN.qmd#abyssalbuttercup). Additionally, [FLYTOPLANKTON](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#flytoplankton) are so hungry for light on the planet that some migrate above THE GARDEN when light is available. Many of these die showering a food source for the [BURNACLES](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#burnacles). However, the conditions would be too lethal if not for the OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES.

[Taloes (singular = talos)](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Taloes.html) of [Tartarus](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/tartarus.html) are animated beings made from the bounties of [Tartarus](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/tartarus.html). They generally consist of local resources.

__OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES__ are sentient beings made of lava and obsidian. 

They are each born from different hydrothermal vents. They use their birth vent to grow and breed the most beautiful collection of [ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/THE_GARDEN.qmd#abyssalbuttercup). 

To maintain life in __THE GARDEN__ the __TALOES__ stimmy the flow of lava by slightly blocking them with obsidian. It is a fine balance so pressure does not build up and cause an explosive eruption.

If the [ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/THE_GARDEN.qmd#abyssalbuttercup) of a TALOS is not well fed the TALOS will hunt JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS as a source of nutrition.

### OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS

6HP \| 1 ARMOR \| TAC:-1 \| FRC:+1 \| RFX:+1 \| CRE:-1

- Obsidian arm blades (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Obsidian lava spear (1D6+2 DAMAGE, talos takes one damage when it creates one, 1 use)
- Obsidian scales (1 ARMOR)
- Fast, and ruthless

__GLASSBLOWER:__ The true form of this talos is lava. The talos can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava.

## ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS {#abyssalbuttercup}

<center>![](images/ABYSSAL_BUTTERCUPS.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px;  background:white"}</center>

These are a form of land based deep sea anemone. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colours. Each of their tentacles looks like a flower giving the appearance of a garland of swaying flowers.

Although they are plant-like in appearance they are actually solitary carnivores. They move slowly, hunting [BURNACLES](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#burnacles). Their ancestors would live by deep sea hydrothermal vents giving them resistance to high temperatures. They originate from __THE GARDEN__ and are found in high concentrations there. However, they can now also be found anywhere that [BURNACLES](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#burnacles) can be found.

### ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP

2HP \| 0 ARMOR \| TAC:0 \| FRC:-1 \| RFX:0 \| CRE:-2

- Land bound sea anemone
- Similar in size and shape of a fez
- Found in a variety of different colours shapes, sizes, and colours
- Flower like stinging tentacles (1 DAMAGE) 
- Fertilised eggs look and act like dandelion seeds
- Soft but fire resistant

__DEADLY-GARLAND:__ The diversity of the flowery shaped tentacles of one __ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP__ is mesmerising. If a person stares at one they will become bonded to it, a person can only be bonded to one at a time. Whilst bonded the person will keep the __ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP__ attached to the top of their head, unable to wear head gear. They will be attracted towards places with the __ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPâ€™S__ prey. If a suitable place is found the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP will leave the host.
