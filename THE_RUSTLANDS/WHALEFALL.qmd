title: "WHALEFALL"
---

The bleached skeleton of a great whale 1.5 kilometres long and 300 metres tall lies atop an outcropping of hexagonal basalt. The __OCTONUT CRABS__ use this as their city. Building their homes on the ribs and spine.

The skeleton is infested with [BURNACLES](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#burnacles). They consume a lot of [FLYTOPLANKTON](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#flytoplankton), the __OCTONUT CRABS__ like these creatures as they are not harmful to them and they keep other creatures away from the skeleton. The [TALOES of THE GARDEN]((/THE_RUSTLANDS/THE_GARDEN.qmd)) dislike this as it majorly decreases the amount of [FLYTOPLANKTON](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#flytoplankton) to feed their [ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/THE_GARDEN.qmd#abyssalbuttercup).

The __OCTONUT CRABS__ are __SENTIENT__ creatures. They are the combination of Coconut crabs and Coconut octopuses. The 2 organisms are completely fused.

They live in huts built upon the great whaleâ€™s skeleton. These huts are made of:

- Shells of the [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs).
- Aluminium struts stolen from [SKYSLIP](/THE_RUSTLANDS/SKYSLIP.qmd).

The __JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS__ herd the [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs) in the [RUSTPLAINS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/RUSTPLAINS.qmd).

The __OCTONUT CRABS__ lay their eggs with the eggs of the [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs). For spawning the [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs) go to the base of the rock outcropping at __WHALEFALL__. The surrounding ground consists of black basalt based sands. This keeps the eggs safe from the [LEECH WORMS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/RUSTPLAINS.qmd#leechworms). However, the [ICEFISH](/THE_RUSTLANDS/SKYSLIP.qmd#ICEFISH) have started stealing these clutches of eggs for their own purposes.

### JUVENILE OCTONUT CRAB {#juvoctonutcrab}

3HP \| 0 ARMOR \| TAC:+1 \| FRC:0 \| RFX:-1 \| CRE:+1

- 0.5m tall & 2 m wide (leg tip to leg tip) Coconut crab
- Fusion of Coconut crab & Coconut octopus (physiologically & mentally)
- Eyes of Octopus
- Mouth area is the tentacle and beak of Octopus
- Claw strike (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Soft exoskeleton
- Inquisitive & curious mind
- Excellent climber
- Keen sense of smell

__HERDERS:__ Once old enough juveniles are put to work by their bullying seniors. They herd flocks of [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs). Juveniles can communicate with their flock, an ability they lose as they age into an adult.

### ADULT OCTONUT CRAB {#adultoctonutcrab}

6HP \| 2 ARMOR \| TAC:+1 \| FRC:+2 \| RFX:0 \| CRE:+2

- 1m tall & 4 m wide (leg tip to leg tip) Coconut crab
- Fusion of Coconut crab & Coconut octopus (physiologically & mentally)
- Eyes of Octopus
- Mouth area is the tentacle and beak of Octopus
- Claw strike (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- Hard exoskeleton adorned with a backward facing shell of a RUSTY HORSESHOE CRAB (2 ARMOR)
- Philosophical & slow decision makers
- Excellent climber
- Keen sense of smell

__DEVOURERS:__ The combination of crab and octopus hungers for food of the mind and gut. They will primarily eat their [RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#rustyhorseshoecrabs). They are surprisingly stealthy, able to burrow and live under the surface for days at a time.

These large horseshoe crabs flock in the [RUSTPLAINS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/RUSTPLAINS.qmd) eating the [LEECH WORMS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/RUSTPLAINS.qmd#leechworms) WORMS within the soils. 

They are herded by the [JUVENILE OCTONUT CRAB](/THE_RUSTLANDS/WHALEFALL.qmd#juvoctonutcrab).  Due to the keen smell, intelligence, and hunger of their herders the population of the __RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS__ has become unsustainable. 

### RUSTY HORSESHOE CRAB

5HP \| 1 ARMOR \| TAC:-3 \| FRC:+2 \| RFX:-1 \| CRE:-3

- 1m wide & 3m long Horseshoe crab
- Covered in a film of rust
- Primitive eyes on back to sense airborne predators
- Hard shell (1 ARMOR)

__MAGNETIC DIET:__ They eat the [LEECH WORMS](/THE_RUSTLANDS/RUSTPLAINS.qmd#leechworms) in the soils of the rustlands. Their diet causes their shells, flesh, and eggs to produce a bioelectromagnetic field. This field disrupts electronics within a 10m radius and ferromagnetic metals (iron, cobalt, steel, nickel, manganese, etc.) stick to their shells if they get very near.
