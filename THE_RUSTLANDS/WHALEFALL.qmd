title: "WHALEFALL"
---

The bleached skeleton of a great whale 1.5 kilometres long and 300 metres tall lies atop an outcropping of hexagonal basalt. The OCTONUT CRABS use this as their city. Building their homes on the ribs and spine.

The skeleton is infested with BURNACLES. They consume a lot of FLYTOPLANKTON, the OCTONUT CRABS like these creatures as they are not harmful to them and they keep other creatures away from the skeleton. The TALOES of THE GARDEN dislike this as it majorly decreases the amount of FLYTOPLANKTON to feed their ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS.

The OCTONUT CRABS are SENTIENT creatures. They are the combination of Coconut crabs and Coconut octopuses. The 2 organisms are completely fused.

They live in huts built upon the great whaleâ€™s skeleton. These huts are made of:
Shells of the RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS.
Aluminium struts. Stolen from SKYSLIP.

The JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS herd the RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS in the RUSTFIELDS.

The OCTONUT CRABS lay their eggs with the eggs of the RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS. For spawning the RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS go to the base of the rock outcropping at WHALEFALL. The surrounding ground consists of black basalt based sands. This keeps the eggs safe from the LEECH WORMS. However, the ICEFISH have started stealing these clutches of eggs for their own purposes.

### JUVENILE OCTONUT CRAB {#juvoctonutcrab}

3HP \| 0 ARMOR \| TAC:+1 \| FRC:0 \| RFX:-1 \| CRE:+1

- 0.5m tall & 2 m wide (leg tip to leg tip) Coconut crab
- Fusion of Coconut crab & Coconut octopus (physiologically & mentally)
- Eyes of Octopus
- Mouth area is the tentacle and beak of Octopus
- Claw strike (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Soft exoskeleton
- Inquisitive & curious mind
- Excellent climber
- Keen sense of smell

__HERDERS:__ Once old enough juveniles are put to work by their bullying seniors. They herd flocks of RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS. Juveniles can communicate with their flock, an ability they lose as they age into an adult.

### ADULT OCTONUT CRAB {#adultoctonutcrab}

6HP \| 2 ARMOR \| TAC:+1 \| FRC:+2 \| RFX:0 \| CRE:+2

- 1m tall & 4 m wide (leg tip to leg tip) Coconut crab
- Fusion of Coconut crab & Coconut octopus (physiologically & mentally)
- Eyes of Octopus
- Mouth area is the tentacle and beak of Octopus
- Claw strike (1D6+1 DAMAGE)
- Hard exoskeleton adorned with a backward facing shell of a RUSTY HORSESHOE CRAB (2 ARMOR)
- Philosophical & slow decision makers
- Excellent climber
- Keen sense of smell

__DEVOURERS:__ The combination of crab and octopus hungers for food of the mind and gut. They will primarily eat their RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS. They are surprisingly stealthy, able to burrow and live under the surface for days at a time.

## RUSTY HORSEHOSE CRABS {#rustyhorseshoecrabs}

These large horseshoe crabs flock in the RUSTFIELDS eating the LEECH WORMS within the soils. 

They are herded by the JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS.  Due to the keen smell, intelligence, and hunger of their herders the population of the RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS has become unsustainable. 

### RUSTY HORSESHOE CRAB

5HP \| 1 ARMOR \| TAC:-3 \| FRC:+2 \| RFX:-1 \| CRE:-3

- 1m wide & 3m long Horseshoe crab
- Covered in a film of rust
- Primitive eyes on back to sense airborne predators
- Hard shell (1 ARMOR)

__MAGNETIC DIET:__ They eat the LEECH WORMS in the soils of the rustlands. Their diet causes their shells, flesh, and eggs to produce a bioelectromagnetic field. This field disrupts electronics within a 10m radius and ferromagnetic metals (iron, cobalt, steel, nickel, manganese, etc.) stick to their shells if they get very near.
