Enter a world ravaged by the war of __TARTARUS__ and __PROTEUS__ , the Primeval deities of earth and water. 
The water has been consumed by the earth and the iron of the world rapidly rusts. 
Few places are safe from the globe encompassing storms of ice, rocks, and lightning. 
These large circles, eyes of the storm, are protected by large Orange Lemon Trees called __LEMAN TREES__. 
__GAIA__ and __NYXMERA__ teaming up to try to preserve some life.

The team will enter one of these safe zones to find an enclosing circle. 
What was once a 100 mile radius zone is only 10. 
Its inhabitants of once aquatic life have become greedy and wary of each other. 
If they collaborated they could yet save the zone. 
Instead the pressure leads them to compete and steal from one another. 
The LEMAN SERPENTS want a war to feed the __LEMAN TREE__ and __NYXMERA__. 
Will this only become a destructive cycle? 
Doesn’t life consist of cycles?
Won’t it make good drama for the ever watchful eye of __NYXMERA__?

## THE RUSTING

Due to the effect of PROTEUS, iron rapidly rusts in the RUSTLANDS (including haemoglobin). This has caused many creatures to go extinct but some are able to survive by various means.

All the living creatures outside of the LEMAN GROVE do not use haemoglobin in their blood or they don’t need blood. 

Many arthropods, including Crustaceans (OCTONUT CRABS, RUSTY HORSESHOE CRABS, and BURNACLES) use hemocyanin, a copper based molecule, for oxygen transport. 
This gives them blue oxygenated blood and clear deoxygenated blood. 

The ICEFISH although fish have no haemoglobin, instead transporting blood in their plasma. This requires very high blood pressure.

Many of the creatures of the LEMAN GROVE and most likely the player characters will require haemoglobin. Thankfully the presence of the LEMANS from the LEMAN TREE protects the consumers’ haemoglobin. A normal sized human needs to consume 1 LEMAN each day for this protective effect.

## JUSANT

In this world most of the waters have been drained into the land or escaped as storms in the sky. 
The LEMAN TREE prevents drain at the LEMAN GROVE. 
The ICEFISH try to maintain the water levels in their CORAL MOAT.

## TEMPEST

Storms of ice, rocks, and lightning surround the globe, only abated by the presence of LEMAN TREES scattered around the planet. 
Entering the storms means certain death.

## SENTIENT CREATURES

Many of the creatures, but not all, are SENTIENT and can be communicated with. 
However, verbal communication is impossible and instead the characters may gain the ability to telepathically communicate with the SENTIENT creatures. 
To gain this ability they will need to consume a LEMAN from the LEMAN TREE at the LEMAN GROVE. The first will most likely be offered by the LEMAN SERPENTS.

SENTIENT creatures include:

- LEMAN SERPENTS
- NOSEY MONKEYS
- OCTONUT CRABS (JUVENILE & ADULT)
- ICEFISH
- OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES

## CONFLICTS

There are three competing factions who dislike each other for the following reasons.

- The ICEFISH steal the eggs of the HORSESHOE CRABS and the OCTONUT CRABS.
- The OCTONUT CRABS steal aluminium from the ICEFISH to use as struts for their high mounted dwellings.
- The TALOES are angered by the high presence of BURNACLES on the giant whale skeleton WHALEFALL, the OCTONUT CRABS’ home.
- The TALOES hunt JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS as a source of food for their garden.
- The ICEFISH kidnap OBSIDAN LAVA TALOES. They encage them and force them to heat their kilns used to melt and reuse aluminium and other metals.
- The CORAL MOAT of the ICEFISH has become infested by ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS. They blame the TALOES.
