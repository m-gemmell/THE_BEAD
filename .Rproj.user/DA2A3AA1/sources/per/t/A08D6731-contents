title: "THE GARDEN"
---

THE GRADEN is in a dried up deep sea oceanic trench. The way down is steep and dangerous. 

The bottom is even more dangerous. The air is thick with toxic particulates and the ground is crisscrossed with thin streams of lava. These both come from the plethora of obsidian covered hydrothermal vents. 

Life does exist down here. The long tapered chimney like vents are covered in the heat tolerant BURNACLES and ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS. Additionally, FLYTOPLANKTON are so hungry for light on the planet that some migrate above THE GARDEN when light is available. Many of these die showering a food source for the BURNACLES. However, the conditions would be too lethal if not for the OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES.

Taloes (singular = talos) of Tartarus are animated beings made from the bounties of Tartarus. They generally consist of local resources.

OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES are sentient beings made of lava and obsidian. 

They are each born from different hydrothermal vents. They use their birth vent to grow and breed the most beautiful collection of ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS. 

To maintain life in THE GARDEN the TALOES stimmy the flow of lava by slightly blocking them with obsidian. It is a fine balance so pressure does not build up and cause an explosive eruption.

If the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS of a TALOS is not well fed the TALOS will hunt JUVENILE OCTONUT CRABS as a source of nutrition.

### OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOS

6HP \| 1 ARMOR \| TAC:-1 \| FRC:+1 \| RFX:+1 \| CRE:-1

- Obsidian arm blades (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Obsidian lava spear (1D6+2 DAMAGE, talos takes one damage when it creates one, 1 use)
- Obsidian scales (1 ARMOR)
- Fast, and ruthless

__GLASSBLOWER:__ The true form of this talos is lava. The talos can change any lava that is part of it or touches it to obsidian of any shape. With this ability it creates an obsidian based skeleton, armor, and weapons. Additionally, it can change obsidian back into lava.

## ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS {#abyssalbuttercup}

<center>![](images/ABYSSAL_BUTTERCUPS.png){style="width:200px; border-radius:15px;  background:white"}</center>

These are a form of land based deep sea anemone. They come in a variety of shapes, sizes, and colours. Each of their tentacles looks like a flower giving the appearance of a garland of swaying flowers.

Although they are plant-like in appearance they are actually solitary carnivores. They move slowly, hunting BURNACLES. Their ancestors would live by deep sea hydrothermal vents giving them resistance to high temperatures. They originate from THE GARDEN and are found in high concentrations there. However, they can now also be found anywhere that BURNACLES can be found.

### ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP

2HP \| 0 ARMOR \| TAC:0 \| FRC:-1 \| RFX:0 \| CRE:-2

- Land bound sea anemone
- Similar in size and shape of a fez
- Found in a variety of different colours shapes, sizes, and colours
- Flower like stinging tentacles (1 DAMAGE) 
- Fertilised eggs look and act like dandelion seeds
- Soft but fire resistant

__DEADLY-GARLAND:__ The diversity of the flowery shaped tentacles of one ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP is mesmerising. If a person stares at one they will become bonded to it, a person can only be bonded to one at a time. Whilst bonded the person will keep the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP attached to the top of their head, unable to wear head gear. They will be attracted towards places with the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPâ€™S prey. If a suitable place is found the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUP will leave the host.
