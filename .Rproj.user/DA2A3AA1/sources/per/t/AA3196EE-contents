SKYSLIP is a graveyard of ancient aircrafts surrounded by the CORAL MOAT, a ring of coral filled waters. This is the domain of the ICEFISH.

## CORAL MOAT

The CORAL MOAT contains a reef of life. 

The CORAL produces toxins that harm or kill other organisms not adapted to the  CORAL MOAT. This is mainly a defence mechanism against the CRABS. However, this will harm other creatures such as humans. 

The top of the food chain are the sentient ICEFISH, who mainly live in the CORAL MOAT as normal fish would.

Recently the CORAL MOAT has been infested with ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS. Although there are no BURNACLES in the water the ABYSSAL BUTTERCUPS eat the Krill in the moat. This is a nuisance to the ICEFISH who need the krill as their primary food source. They blame the TALOES for this infestation.

### ICEFISH {#ICEFISH}

2HP \| 0 ARMOR \| TAC:0 \| FRC:-1 \| RFX:2 \| CRE:0

- Icefish
- Bite (1 DAMAGE)
- Sentient
- Fast swimmer
- Immune to the coral toxins
- Stressed

__HYPERTENSION:__ Icefish do not have haemoglobin, instead their plasm transports oxygen. This requires high pressures and causes all the Icefish to seem extremely stressed and short tempered at all times. They can exude their pressure to control the movement of water near them.

With the metals of the graveyard the ICEFISH build and create many useful inventions.

The ICEFISH build reverse diving suits (water on the inside) with the aluminium in the graveyard. When a suit is made available the smartest ICEFISH of the CORAL MOAT is chosen to inhabit it. There are only a few suits and so only a few ARMOURED ICEFISH exist. 

Compared to the past the ARMOURED ICEFISH spend more time and resources making thundersticks to keep the TALOES and CRABS away. To create thermite they use the aluminium of their aircrafts with the rust found in the RUSTPLAINS.

They steal RUSTY HORSESHOE CRAB eggs to use as the magnets of devices to gather rust from the RUSTFIELDS. Whilst gathering these eggs they inadvertently gather OCTONUT CRAB eggs which they eat as snacks.

The ARMORED ICEFISH maintain metal pumps that pump water to the surface, maintaining the CORAL MOAT. Unfortunately they are now being ignored.  The water is now low enough that dead coral can be seen pointing above the waterline. Only the ICEFISH in the moat with their water manipulation are keeping it afloat for now.

In the heart of the graveyard are the kilns. Here the ARMOURED ICEFISH use kidnapped and encaged OBSIDIAN LAVA TALOES to melt down aluminium and other metals.

### ICEFISH SPHERE {#icefishsphere}

3HP \| 1 ARMOR \| TAC:0 \| FRC:-1 \| RFX:1 \| CRE:0

- Icefish in a glass sphere filled with water
- 1 metre diamter glass sphere made of gunzhip gunner dock (1 ARMOR)
- Roll attack (1D6 DAMAGE)
- Water cannon (1 DAMAGE, 1D6+2 DAMAGE against lava and fire creatures)

__BALLER:__ The fish use their waterkinesis abilities to roll the sphere and they can cover allies with the sphere.
If the target of their roll attack tries to evade the evader gains advantage as the momentum of the sphere makes it difficult for the Icefish to change course.

### ARMOURED ICEFISH {#armouredicefish}

12HP \| 2 ARMOR \| TAC:1 \| FRC:1 \| RFX:0 \| CRE:0

- Icefish in a 2.5 metre tall human shaped reverse diving suit it controls through manipulating the water inside it
- Aluminum diving suit (2 ARMOR)
- Anchor (1D6+1 DAMAGE, GIGANTIC)
- 5 Thundersticks, thermite based spear (1D6+2 DAMAGE, ANTI-MATERIAL, 1 use)

__METAL-FABRICATOR:__ Only Icefish with a mind for metal crafting are chosen to inhabit a suit. Given the tools, materials, and motivation they can build anything they can imagine. Unfortunately their world is very small with little fuel and so they are not highly imaginative.
