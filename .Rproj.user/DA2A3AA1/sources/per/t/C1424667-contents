Text and images created by Matthew R. Gemmell except for for some FIST content.

The BEAD is a massive bead shaped structure powered by the [4 Primeval Deities](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/) to explore other dimensions.
Jaws of TARTARUS as a threshold to safely separate worlds whilst a tree of GAIA unites them. 
An eye of NYXMERA to power the craft whilst the water of PROTEUS prevents death by this same power.
