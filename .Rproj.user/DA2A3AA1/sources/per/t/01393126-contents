title: "LAVAWOODS"
---

- LArge volcano in the centre
- Volcanic area mainly solidified by being next to the WATERWOODS
- Covered in lava cactuses
- When players enter area they will see a large Kaiju emerge from a DOT, then a gargantuan Obsidian lava talos will emerge from the volcano to vanquish it. IT will go back into the lava when done but can be called upon by the Kraken forces that occupy the area.
- Too hot for Cyborg abyssal buttercups to work

"The sheer mass of the gargantuan Talos causes its stumped legs to crack and shatter with a volcanic explosion with every step. However, as it lifts its legs it brings lava up with it, its large and long strides allowing the leg to fully reassemble before it crashes down once more"

- The main source of power for Amazonia's forces by the volcano.
