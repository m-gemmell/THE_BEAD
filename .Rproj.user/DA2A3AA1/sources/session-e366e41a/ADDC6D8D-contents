This is a website to host faction information of the Primeval deities for the FIST RPG. It is a work in progress. Text and images created by Matthew R. Gemmell except for for some FIST content.

There are four factions, each led by a Primeval deity; [Nyxmera](nyxmera.qmd), [Tartarus](tartarus.qmd), [Proteus](proteus.qmd), and [Gaia](gaia.qmd).
They compete and collaborate in various ways.
Importantly, each faction is not united and there are many sub factions with various goals and aims.

Please use these materials as you would like.
You can be completely loyal and base your world on the [alternate history](/history.qmd) of this earth.
You can add the factions into your world and use some of my [missions](missions.qmd).
You can use various stat blocks such as the [TARATARUS RAIDER](/Tartarus/DOT_raiders.qmd#raider) and reskin them as one of your factions.
Use the contents as you will in your own game.
