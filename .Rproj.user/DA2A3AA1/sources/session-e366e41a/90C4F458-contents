Nyxmera is the light. All the celestial bodies are known as the eyes of Nyxmera, the sun, the grey moon, the purple moon, the gas planets, and the stars. With these Nyxmera watches, it wants to be intrigued. Something its followers, Suns of Nyxmera, are more than happy to facilitate.

Nyxmera is everything but Earth. It craves what it can’t take. There is so much of interest on such tiny orbs or dirt, so Nyxmera is stuck in a perpetual gaze at the planets of Tartarus.

Its logo represents the duality of the sky and Nyxmera’s eyes. On one side the blue sky and sun. On the other, the night sky with the Grey Moon and Purple Moon. Nyxmera loves extremes; good and evil, comedy and drama, love and war.


## The Eyes of Nyxmera

Nyxmera’s presence is felt on Earth in various ways. 
Its eyes are always staring and so its followers seek to entertain it. 
Meteors and meteorites are a major source of Nyxmera’s gifts and punishments. 
Craters and meteorites are special to the Suns of Nyxmera, used to create outdoor stages. 
Many say Nyxmera was bored of watching dinosaurs and so sent a meteorite like one may change the channel.
