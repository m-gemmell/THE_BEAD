It is able to understand basic commands. It will not tolerate any abuse and demands a lot of affection. Although it can speak a little it much prefers to make pitch perfect sound effects with its Lyrebird vocal organ (syrinx) to communicate.\n\n### Downtime and upgrades\n\nBetween quests the players can relax in the village, make friends with __Bab__, __Yaga__, and the other villagers. The PCs can also help out the villagers, including __Bab__ and __Yaga__.\nIf they help, their final Bird House could have some upgrades.\n\nThe referee/GM is encouraged referee to give a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 upgrades.\nAdditionally, it is encouraged to collabortate with the players on the shape and utility of these upgrades.\nSome suggestions are:\n\n- Hardened wood: Increase ARMOR from 1 to 2\n- Specialised work stations: This could be for chemistry, tinkering, medicine, weaponsmithing etc.\n- Mounted harpoon gun: 1D6 DAMAGE, can hook onto vehicles and other objects\n- Paragliders: Allows for aerial drops\n\n# Minor Islands\n\nFloating around the Central island are the minor islands. \nThey are constantly moving making it impossible to travel by foot.\n\nTo travel to an Island the PCs either need a method to travel a few miles through incredibly windy conditions or ask a trader for transport.\nA trader will help the PCs to get to the island and back via their BIRD HOUSE every other day.\nIn other words the PCs have a rest day after coming back from one island.\n\n## Gourd Island\n\n<center>\n\n![](images/gourd_vulture.png){style=\"width:200px; background:#0082c8; border-radius:5px \"}\n\n</center>\n\nAn Island inhabited by [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll), [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture), and the Gourd Groundsels.\nAside from these the only other life includes flying bugs too small to be noticed by these massive inhabitants.\n\nWhen the [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) lived in the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd) they would regularly play fight with members of their community.\nOf course when you can perfectly regenerate (as long as there is no fire or acid involved) this leads to many lost limbs.\nThe largest and bravest vultures capitalised on these opportunities.\n\nBy consuming the flesh of [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) the vultures rapidly mutated into [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture). Massive regenerating vultures able to carry the weight of a [GOAT TROLL](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) due to the high winds of the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd).\nThe 2 species partnered together making their new home on Gourd Island and hunting and scavenging the surrounding lands.\n\nGourd Island was not just useful due to its elevation but also due to its flora.\nThe Gourd Groundsels are engorged with all the water they can capture on the island, leaving none for any other creatures, except the [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) and their animal companions.\nYou will never see a [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) without the gourd they strap to their backs.\nUsed to quench the thirst of themselves and their vultures.\n\nThey occasionally trade one of their [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture) to other humanoids.\nThis may be in exchange for a quest or for an amazing hunting weapon.\n\n[Link to GOAT TROLLS and VULTURE TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#BEZOAR)\n\n## Fork Island\n\n<center>\n\n![](images/lyrebird.png){style=\"width:200px; background:#0082c8; border-radius:5px \"}\n\n</center>\n\nTwo main features are apparent when entering this island.\nThe first is the thin and tall bifurcated groundsels with their forked leaves.\nThe second is the cacophony of noises.\nThe buzzing of insects, the winds rustling the leaves, and most importantly the Lyre birds.\n\nThe Lyre birds sing their songs, attempting and succeeding in being the lead vocals.\nThey yell their sharp loud pitches for a variety of reasons.\nThey concuss any predatory birds foolhardy enough to hunt them.\nThey make beautiful melodies to attract mates and use their volume to scare off the competition.\nBut possibly most importantly of all, through their mastery of pitch and recreating any sound imaginable they can play the key song of the leaves of the forked groundsels.\n\nThe leaves of the forked groundsels act as super precise tuning forks.\nEach leaf has a specific sound with a specific tone, pitch, and decibel that will activate it.\nOnce activated the leaf will franticly vibrate and eventually fall off the tree.\nThese forked leaves being a major source of nutrition for the forked lyrebirds.\n\n## Tryp Island\n\nThe island's surface is littered with large holes.\nThese lead to one large hole found at the very bottom.\nThese tunnels act as a wind funnel, air sucked from the bottom and blown out the surface.\n\nThe strong upward winds causes many rocks and clods of dirt to float up in the air.\n\nWhite storks are able to construct strong nests of rocks, dirt, & wood.\nThese houses are tied to the incredibly tall giant groundsels that wave erratically in the wind.\n\nThe White storks feed on bugs that are sucked up by the massive hole at the bottom of the island.\nThey also eat voles and frogs found on the surface of the Island as well as hunting on the surrounding islands.\n\n## Jungle island\n\nAs the name suggests this island is covered in thick vegetation made of a variety of Giant groundsels. It is the largest island and about the size and .\n\nWithin the jungle __Mountain fowl__ eat __bugs and vegetation__. The __Mountain Fowl__ are in turn ate by the __Tall Pelicans__. The __Tall Pelicans__ keep their prey in their leathery throat pouches till they return to their nests on various small floating islands.\n\nThe reason for this is simple, they use their prey as an offering to the massive predatory __HORROR BIRDS__ of the jungle. Unable to fly whilst in the thick jungle they found the best defence was to appease their predators. Better to live and starve than to die satiated.\n\nWithin the jungle there are small lakes with aggressive Geese even the __HORROR BIRDS__ stay away from.\n\nThrough not as noisy as Fork island their are many __Macaws__ within the tree tops.\nThey mimic the voices of creatures and humans that have traversed the jungle.\nThis can include the PCs, __Mountain fowl__, __Tall Pelicans__, and, __Elephant birds__.\n\n### HORROR BIRD\n\n20HP 0 ARMOR TAC:+1 \\| FRC:+2 \\| RFX:-1 \\| CRE:-1\n\n-   Akin to a [Terror bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorusrhacidae#) but larger\n-   Carnivorous\n-   Large claws and beak (1D6+3 DAMAGE)\n-   Solitary hunters\n\n__VENAL:__ The __HORROR BIRD__ is a massive creature that seems terrifying and they are. However, they primarily use their size and power to bully others. They fight members of their own species for territory. They intentionally seek other creatures who have captured prey to intimidate and steal their kill. They tend to let down their guard around creatures they appear to have successfully intimidated.\n\n# Attack from the Doppelgangers\n\n- The attack is way too large for the PCs and villagers to handle, they must evacuate.\n- The PCs will be tasked with helping get farmers back to the village so everyone can evacuate by the bird houses\n- Doppelgangers are stealing the island to use as their main base in the SANDWOODS\n\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<center>\n\n![](images/SKYWOODS.png){style=\"width:200px\"}\n\n</center>\n\nThe SKYWOODS is an archipelago of sky bound islands high above the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd).\nTheir unnaturally flat tops bely their true origin, upside down mountain tips.\nThey come from the mountains of the [REDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/REDWOODS.qmd), now a range of mesas.\nTheir previous lives are evident by their foundations, rough and tapering to the once mountain tip.\n\n# Endemic life\n\nLife struggles at the high altitudes of the SKYWOODS.\nBut where many struggle, few thrive.\nThese survivors have adapted in specific ways, giving rise to unique species on the different islands.\n\n## Giant groundsels\n<center>\n\n[![Senecio kilimanjari](images/Senecio_kilimanjari.jpg){style=\"width:200px;

It is able to understand basic commands. It will not tolerate any abuse and demands a lot of affection. Although it can speak a little it much prefers to make pitch perfect sound effects with its Lyrebird vocal organ (syrinx) to communicate.\n\n### Downtime and upgrades\n\nBetween quests the players can relax in the village, make friends with __Bab__, __Yaga__, and the other villagers. The PCs can also help out the villagers, including __Bab__ and __Yaga__.\nIf they help, their final Bird House could have some upgrades.\n\nThe referee/GM is encouraged referee to give a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 4 upgrades.\nAdditionally, it is encouraged to collabortate with the players on the shape and utility of these upgrades.\nSome suggestions are:\n\n- Hardened wood: Increase ARMOR from 1 to 2\n- Specialised work stations: This could be for chemistry, tinkering, medicine, weaponsmithing etc.\n- Mounted harpoon gun: 1D6 DAMAGE, can hook onto vehicles and other objects\n- Paragliders: Allows for aerial drops\n\n# Minor Islands\n\nFloating around the Central island are the minor islands. \nThey are constantly moving making it impossible to travel by foot.\n\nTo travel to an Island the PCs either need a method to travel a few miles through incredibly windy conditions or ask a trader for transport.\nA trader will help the PCs to get to the island and back via their BIRD HOUSE every other day.\nIn other words the PCs have a rest day after coming back from one island.\n\n## Gourd Island\n\n<center>\n\n![](images/gourd_vulture.png){style=\"width:200px; background:#0082c8; border-radius:5px \"}\n\n</center>\n\nAn Island inhabited by [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll), [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture), and the Gourd Groundsels.\nAside from these the only other life includes flying bugs too small to be noticed by these massive inhabitants.\n\nWhen the [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) lived in the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd) they would regularly play fight with members of their community.\nOf course when you can perfectly regenerate (as long as there is no fire or acid involved) this leads to many lost limbs.\nThe largest and bravest vultures capitalised on these opportunities.\n\nBy consuming the flesh of [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) the vultures rapidly mutated into [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture). Massive regenerating vultures able to carry the weight of a [GOAT TROLL](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) due to the high winds of the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd).\nThe 2 species partnered together making their new home on Gourd Island and hunting and scavenging the surrounding lands.\n\nGourd Island was not just useful due to its elevation but also due to its flora.\nThe Gourd Groundsels are engorged with all the water they can capture on the island, leaving none for any other creatures, except the [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) and their animal companions.\nYou will never see a [GOAT TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#goat-troll) without the gourd they strap to their backs.\nUsed to quench the thirst of themselves and their vultures.\n\nThey occasionally trade one of their [TROLL VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture) to other humanoids.\nThis may be in exchange for a quest or for an amazing hunting weapon.\n\n[Link to GOAT TROLLS and VULTURE TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#BEZOAR)\n\n## Fork Island\n\n<center>\n\n![](images/lyrebird.png){style=\"width:200px; background:#0082c8; border-radius:5px \"}\n\n</center>\n\nTwo main features are apparent when entering this island.\nThe first is the thin and tall bifurcated groundsels with their forked leaves.\nThe second is the cacophony of noises.\nThe buzzing of insects, the winds rustling the leaves, and most importantly the Lyre birds.\n\nThe Lyre birds sing their songs, attempting and succeeding in being the lead vocals.\nThey yell their sharp loud pitches for a variety of reasons.\nThey concuss any predatory birds foolhardy enough to hunt them.\nThey make beautiful melodies to attract mates and use their volume to scare off the competition.\nBut possibly most importantly of all, through their mastery of pitch and recreating any sound imaginable they can play the key song of the leaves of the forked groundsels.\n\nThe leaves of the forked groundsels act as super precise tuning forks.\nEach leaf has a specific sound with a specific tone, pitch, and decibel that will activate it.\nOnce activated the leaf will franticly vibrate and eventually fall off the tree.\nThese forked leaves being a major source of nutrition for the forked lyrebirds.\n\n## Tryp Island\n\nThe island's surface is littered with large holes.\nThese lead to one large hole found at the very bottom.\nThese tunnels act as a wind funnel, air sucked from the bottom and blown out the surface.\n\nThe strong upward winds causes many rocks and clods of dirt to float up in the air.\n\nWhite storks are able to construct strong nests of rocks, dirt, & wood.\nThese houses are tied to the incredibly tall giant groundsels that wave erratically in the wind.\n\nThe White storks feed on bugs that are sucked up by the massive hole at the bottom of the island.\nThey also eat voles and frogs found on the surface of the Island as well as hunting on the surrounding islands.\n\n## Jungle island\n\nAs the name suggests this island is covered in thick vegetation made of a variety of Giant groundsels. It is the largest island and about the size and .\n\nWithin the jungle __Mountain fowl__ eat __bugs and vegetation__. The __Mountain Fowl__ are in turn ate by the __Tall Pelicans__. The __Tall Pelicans__ keep their prey in their leathery throat pouches till they return to their nests on various small floating islands.\n\nThe reason for this is simple, they use their prey as an offering to the massive predatory __HORROR BIRDS__ of the jungle. Unable to fly whilst in the thick jungle they found the best defence was to appease their predators. Better to live and starve than to die satiated.\n\nWithin the jungle there are small lakes with aggressive Geese even the __HORROR BIRDS__ stay away from.\n\nThrough not as noisy as Fork island their are many __Macaws__ within the tree tops.\nThey mimic the voices of creatures and humans that have traversed the jungle.\nThis can include the PCs, __Mountain fowl__, __Tall Pelicans__, and, __Elephant birds__.\n\n### HORROR BIRD\n\n20HP 0 ARMOR TAC:+1 \\| FRC:+2 \\| RFX:-1 \\| CRE:-1\n\n-   Akin to a [Terror bird](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phorusrhacidae#) but larger\n-   Carnivorous\n-   Large claws and beak (1D6+3 DAMAGE)\n-   Solitary hunters\n\n__VENAL:__ The __HORROR BIRD__ is a massive creature that seems terrifying and they are. However, they primarily use their size and power to bully others. They fight members of their own species for territory. They intentionally seek other creatures who have captured prey to intimidate and steal their kill. They tend to let down their guard around creatures they appear to have successfully intimidated.\n\n# Attack from the Doppelgangers\n\n- The attack is way too large for the PCs and villagers to handle, they must evacuate.\n- The PCs will be tasked with helping get farmers back to the village so everyone can evacuate by the bird houses\n- Doppelgangers are stealing the island to use as their main base in the SANDWOODS\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"SKYWOODS.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
