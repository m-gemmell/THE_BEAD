first is the thin and tall bifurcated groundsels with their forked leaves.\nThe second is the cacophony of noises.\nThe buzzing of insects, the winds rustling the leaves, and most importantly the lyre birds.\n\nThe Lyre birds sing their songs, attempting and succeeding in being the lead vocals.\nThey yell their sharp loud pitches for a variety of reasons.\nThey concuss any predatory birds foolhardy enough to hunt them.\nThey make beautiful melodies to attract mates and use their volume to scare off the competition.\nBut possibly most importantly of all, through their mastery of pitch and recreating any sound imaginable they can play the key song of the leaves of the forked groundsels.\n\nThe leaves of the forked groundsels act as super precise tuning forks.\nEach leaf has a specific sound with a specific tone, pitch, and decibel that will activate it.\nOnce activated the leaf will franticly vibrate and eventually fall off the tree.\nThese forked leaves being a major source of nutrition for the forked lyrebirds.\n\n# Attack from the Doppelgangers\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\nAn archipelago of sky bound islands high above the [WINDWOODS](/DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd).\nTheir

VULTURES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#troll-vulture) to other humanoids.\nThis may be in exchange for a quest or for an amazing hunting weapon.\n\n[Link to GOAT TROLLS and VULTURE TROLLS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Tartarus/Keystones.html#BEZOAR)\n\n## Fork Island\n\nTwo main features are apparent when entering this island.\nThe first is the thin and tall bifurcated groundsels with their forked leaves.\nThe second is the cacophony of noises.\nThe buzzing of insects, the winds rustling the leaves, and most importantly the lyre birds.\n\nThe Lyre birds sing their songs, attempting and succeeding in being the lead vocals.\nThey yell their sharp loud pitches for a variety of reasons.\nThey concuss any predatory birds foolhardy enough to hunt them.\nThey make beautiful melodies to attract mates and use their volume to scare off the competition.\nBut possibly most importantly of all, through their mastery of pitch and recreating any sound imaginable they can play the key song of the leaves of the forked groundsels.\n\nThe leaves of the forked groundsels act as super precise tuning forks.\nEach leaf has a specific sound with a specific tone, pitch, and decibel that will activate it.\nOnce activated the leaf will franticly vibrate and eventually fall off the tree.\nThese forked leaves being a major source of nutrition for the forked lyrebirds.\n\n# Attack from the Doppelgangers\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","toc":true,"output-file":"SKYWOODS.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
