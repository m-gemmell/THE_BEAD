If the solar tower has be sabotaged successfully only one of these will be functional, one at the top.\n-   Doppelganger guards: There will be less guards if the desalination and bonehead base have been sabotaged. This is due to the redirecting of forces and that some of the forces will have to leave the DENDROSPHAERA as there is not enough provisions to maintain them all.\n\n# Fauna and Flora\n\nThe three major fauna and flora of the SANDWOODS are cactuses, BONEHEADS, and Giant Antlions (GIANT LARVAL ANTLIONS and GIANT ADULT ANTLIONS).\n\nThe SANDWOODS was once covered in a forest of cactuses. Now there is only a scattering os smaller forests. This decimation was caused by the introduction of the BONEHEADS. The BONEHEADS eat the entire cactus but are especially fond of the special rare fruit the cactuses. This fruit can be used to easily tame and ride the BONEHEADS.\n\nThe BONEHEADS are [Pachycephalosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurus) that were created by the [CGC](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Gaia/CGC.html) scientists that occupy the [WATERWOODS](DENDROSPHAERA/WATERWOODS.qmd). As herbivores they generally gather in roaming flocks.\n\nAs the population of BONEHEADS has increased so has the population of Giant [Antlions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antlion). The larvae bury into the sand around the cactuses and ambush the BONEHEADS. This has greatly increased the survival rates of the LARVAL GIANT ANTLIONS which are also able to eat humans. This has therefore increased the amount of ADULT GIANT ANTLIONS.\n\n[DOPPELGANGER DUNES](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Nyxmera/Doppelganger_Dunes.html) use the ADULT GIANT ANTLIONS as massive air-based beasts of burden. The [SKYBOUND DOPPELGANGERS](https://m-gemmell.github.io/Primeval_Deities_FIST/Nyxmera/Doppelganger_Dunes.html#skybound_doppelganger) are able to tame and escort them with their aeolian whistles. They are easy to maintain only needing to feed on airborne pollen that is blown in by the winds of the [WINDWOODS](DENDROSPHAERA/WINDWOODS.qmd). These strong winds also allowing the adults to easily fly despite their size.\n\n## BONEHEADS\n\n5 HP \\| 1 ARMOR \\| TAC:-1 \\| FRC:+1 \\| RFX:0 \\| CRE:-1\n\n- [Pachycephalosaurus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachycephalosaurus)\n- Think bared skull (1D6+1 DAMAGE)\n- Tough skin\n- Herbivorous dinosaur\n- Males have blue and yellow feathers\n- Females have sand coloured feathers\n\n__THICK-SKULLED:__ These creatures are dumb and skittish but they thrive in deserts.
