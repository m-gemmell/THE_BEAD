They feed on the excretions of animals, including the [FLYTOPLANKTON](/THE_RUSTLANDS/FOODCHAIN.qmd#flytoplankton), and the minerals in the sand including the rust. They may also prey on creatures that descend into quick sand.

They are harmless but irritating. \n\nThey regularly fly about during the day. They will land on sun drenched surfaces (including creatures, ground, skeletons, rocks etc) to feed on the light.
